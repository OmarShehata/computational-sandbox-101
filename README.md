# Computational Sandbox 101

In this class you'll learn the fundamentals of coding for the purpose of thinking & communicating in systems. It is designed for "right brained" people who want to be able to better communicate with engineers & know for themselves the limits of what is possible with technology. 

This is for:

- Founders / PMs who want to build & ship complete MVP's themselves
- Scientists / philosophers / writers who want a computational sandbox to think through complex ideas & communicate them
- Software engineers who are specialized in one area or stack, and want to know what's possible "from scratch" / from first principles

If you enjoy vibe coding, you will have to resist the urge to let the AI (or your engineering team) do everything for you. You're here to learn just enough of the fundamentals so you can do things that have never been done before.

\[WIP\] Some of the things this class will cover:

- Running vanilla HTML/JS locally, and deploying it on free static hosts like CodePen & GitHub Pages
- How to read & write data to a simple database, or use a Google Spreadsheet as your database 
- Querying APIs, like an LLM / embedding APIs
- "Creative coding" / real-time computer graphics visualizations  
- Jupyter notebooks for basic data science 
- How to navigate an existing codebase & modify it to your needs

This class is designed to be the smallest amount of fundamental knowledge that can allow you to recreate basic versions of almost anything that can be done on a computer. An example of the bar we're shooting for here is the kinds of web experiments that Nicky Case (https://ncase.me/), Nolan (https://eieio.games/) & Neal (https://neal.fun/) create.

> A program is a building of thought. It is costless to build, it is weightless, and it grows easily under our typing hands. But as a program grows, so does its complexity. **The skill of programming is the skill of building programs that don’t confuse the programmer**. The best programs are those that manage to do something interesting while still being easy to understand.

The goal is to get to a point where even if you aren't writing code, you can tell which types of things are very easy, which are very hard, and why.
