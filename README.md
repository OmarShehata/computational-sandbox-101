# Computational Sandbox 101

In this class you'll learn the fundamentals of coding for the purpose of thinking & communicating in systems. It is designed for "right brained" people who want to be able to better communicate with engineers & be able to know for themselves the limits of what is possible with technology. 

This is for:

- Founders / PMs who want to build & ship complete MVP's themselves
- Scientists / philosophers / writers who want a computational sandbox to think through complex ideas & communicate them
- Software engineers who are specialized in one area or stack, and want to know what's possible "from scratch" / from first principles

If you enjoy vibe coding, you will have to resist the urge to let the AI (or your engineering team) do everything for you. You're here to learn just enough of the fundamentals so you can do things that have never been done before. 

We will cover:

- Running vanilla HTML/JS locally, and deploying it on free static hosts like CodePen & GitHub Pages
- How to read & write data to a simple database, or use a Google Spreadsheet as your database 
- Querying APIs, like an LLM / embedding API
- "Creative coding" / real-time computer graphics visualizations  

This class is designed to be the smallest amount of fundamental knowledge that can allow you to recreate basic versions of almost anything that can be done on a computer. An example of the bar we're shooting for here is the kinds of web experiments that Nolan (https://eieio.games/) & Neal (https://neal.fun/) create.
